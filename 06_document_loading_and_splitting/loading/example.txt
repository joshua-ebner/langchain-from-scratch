Contribution margin is a fundamental concept in business and managerial
accounting.

It represents the portion of revenue that remains after variable costs
have been deducted. This remaining amount contributes toward covering
fixed costs and generating profit.

Understanding contribution margin helps leaders make decisions about
pricing, cost structure, product mix, and scaling. Products with higher
contribution margins generally provide more leverage as volume grows,
while low-margin products may require high scale or strategic justification.

In AI-driven businesses, contribution margin analysis is especially
important when evaluating automation, model inference costs, and
infrastructure efficiency.
