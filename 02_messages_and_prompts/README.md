# Messages and Roles

This section demonstrates how chat-based LLMs distinguish between
different message roles.

The example shows:
- a **system message**, which sets global behavior and constraints
- a **human message**, which provides the user’s input

The key point is that **model behavior can be changed by altering
message roles**, without changing the model or generation parameters.
